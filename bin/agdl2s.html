  <h2>Name</h2>
  <p><strong>AGDL2S</strong>: AGD File Triangle List → Triangle Strip Converter</p>

  <h2>Syntax</h2>
  <p>AGDL2S [Switch] Input file name [Output file name]</p>

  <h2>Functionality</h2>
  <p>
    Splits the triangle list data in the input file (input_file.agd) into some number
    of triangle strip data and outputs it to the output file (output_file.agd). If the
    output file is omitted, an output file with the same name as the input file, and a
    backup of the input file is created in the current directory. If the input file is
    in the current directory it will be overwritten. Data that could not be converted
    to triangle strip data will be left as triangle list data. The program will not
    search for data to convert outside the bounds of each Geometry Data Block. (The
    program will not search for data to convert outside the bounds of the Geometry Data
    Block that is not done in each Geometry Data Block??)
  </p>

  <h2>Switches</h2>
  <div class="switch">-b<br>
    Overwrites the input file without backing it up when the output file is not
    specified.<br>
    The default when omitted is the input file is saved as a “bak” file.
  </div><br>

  <div class="switch">-l [num]<br>
    Specifies the maximum number of polygons to convert to a strip. Normally, it is the
    maximum number of polygons the command can send at one time. However, if a strip
    row that is longer than the maximum value cannot be found, this value is ignored.
    The default when omitted is 34 (the maximum number of polygons that can be sent by
    the vertex normal, vertex color command).
  </div><br>

  <div class="switch">-m [num]<br>
    Specifies the minimum number of polygons to convert to a strip. Normally not
    specified. Set when you want to know how much the Geometry Data is split. (For
    debugging, etc.)<br>
    When this switch is used, strip rows with fewer polygons than the minimum number
    will not be created.<br>
    The default when omitted is 2.
  </div><br>

  <div class="switch">-v<br>
    When vertex normal is specified, even if normal is different, if the coordinate is
    the same, it is treated as the same point.<br>
    When omitted, if the normal is different, it is considered a different point with
    the same coordinate.
  </div><br>

  <div class="switch">-t<br>
    When the texture UV is speficied, even if the UV is different, if the coordinate is
    the same, it is treated as the same point.<br>
    When omitted, if the UV is different, it is considered a different point with the
    same coordinate.

  </div><br>
