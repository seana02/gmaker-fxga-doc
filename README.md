# GMAKER PC-FXGA Documentation Translations
Web pages for the translations of the documentation included in the PC-FXGA GMAKER Version 1.0.

There's a ton of documentation to translate, so this is not complete, and may never be fully complete.
I have also worked on this over a couple years, so it is not entirely consistent across different pages.
There are also some parts that I thought were ambiguous in the original, which I translated to be ambiguous because I don't know what it meant.

Hopefully there is enough here to be a useful starting point.
